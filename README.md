# Prefrence-Order-of-Classifiers-based-on-MCDM-method

This repository contains the implementation code for our project where we rank classifiers using multi-criteria decision-making.
We have applied almost 7 machine learning classfication methods to 5 medical datasets. The classifiers for each dataset are given a preference ranking
based on their performance metrics fed to multi-criteria decision-making systems.
